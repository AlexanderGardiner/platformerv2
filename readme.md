# Platformer Game README

## Overview

This repository hosts a 2D platformer game that I developed to demonstrate my skills in game development, particularly in creating engaging mechanics and seamless gameplay experiences. The game features custom physics, dynamic level loading, and several unique gameplay elements designed to enhance player enjoyment and challenge. This game was created when I was in High School, and played by a large number of my friends who competed for the fastest times.

## Features

### 2D Collision with Rectangular Hitboxes

Implemented precise collision detection using rectangular hitboxes to ensure accurate and responsive interactions between the player and the game environment.

### Dynamic Level Loading

Designed a dynamic level loading system that allows levels to load in real-time, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted gameplay experience.

### Coyote Time

Incorporated "Coyote Time," a feature that gives players a brief moment to jump after leaving a ledge, making the platforming experience more forgiving and enjoyable.

### Dashing Physics

Created a dashing mechanic that enables the player to dash in multiple directions, adding an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the gameplay.

### Jump Pads

Added jump pads throughout the levels to give players an extra boost, allowing for creative navigation and dynamic level design.
